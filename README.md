## Overview
Castle Cruisers is an objective-based 3D racing game (MacOS, Windows) with AI agents, simulated physics, and animations. It was a semester long group project for my [video game design](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6457-video-game-design) class at Georgia Tech! We used the [Unity](https://unity.com/) and C#. 

For an overview, [watch our gameplay trailer](https://youtu.be/tqgv4prsA3E)!
